There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
This is a GREAT place to eat!
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
The service was poor and thats being nice.
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
But the service was beyond bad.
I'm so happy to be here!!!"
Tasted like dirt.
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
The block was amazing.
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".
What did bother me, was the slow service.
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
These were so good we ordered them twice.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
Unfortunately, it was not good.
I had a pretty satifying experience.

Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
